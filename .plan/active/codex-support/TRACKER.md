# Codex support tracker

Plan: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Scope: full user-facing parity on Claude and Codex; Codex-native sandboxed file/command
access approved. The user requested publication and monitoring of the plan PR; implementation is not started.

## Planning evidence

- Initial repository inspection at `516f2b5`; fast-forwarded to `a359823` before publication and inspected its
  packaging/startup/reconnect changes. Plan now preserves npm/npx distribution and adds packed-artifact proof.
- Located/read `sesori-plan-maker` and `sesori-plan-worker` in the sibling monorepo.
- Official App Server, SDK, configuration and permissions documentation inspected.
- Installed `codex-cli 0.154.0` experimental generated schema inspected, not hand-edited or committed.
- No live Codex/Claude turn, native security test, paid smoke, Figma test, or account/config modification performed.
- Dependencies absent in this worktree. `npm ci`, check and build not run for this documentation-only task.

## Qualification gates before user-facing Codex exposure

- [ ] Qualified Codex version and reproducible consumed protocol contracts.
- [ ] Effective profile: notes writes, app-source reads, app-source write denial, explicit scoped approvals.
- [ ] No inherited unrelated MCP/apps/hooks/subagents/network tools or credential copying.
- [ ] All five Figma tools including actual image interpretation, long human questions and annotation policy.
- [ ] Native history replays answers/tool activity after restart and resumes the same provider context.
- [ ] Mid-turn model/effort update, steering and Stop preserve the existing UX.
- [ ] Native dollar estimates work on required auth/model routes, or the user explicitly decides a trustworthy fallback.
- [ ] Legacy Claude settings, instructions, history, costs and behavior remain intact.
- [ ] Packed npm bin, stable plugin installation/upgrade refresh and provider-correct startup work for both.

## Review

Initial plan: **APPROVED**, no architectural violations, read-only `medium-intelligence-fast` run
`3e87c9a5-fb51-40bd-aa8b-885be5fac3cd`. Pre-review gate passed; general Section A applied to this TypeScript repo;
unrelated monorepo Section B workspace diagrams/layers skipped. Runtime qualification remains pending.

Later `a359823` packaging-baseline reconciliation was parent-reviewed only; it preserves the current install flow
and adds artifact verification without changing provider architecture. Do not describe that revision as separately
approved by the subagent.

## Retirement

Required: cumulative L4 and the exact provider/platform/auth/Figma/persistence matrix in PLAN.md. Both backends
must pass user-facing parity. Partial, blocked, failed or unexecuted required coverage keeps this plan active.
Target evidence: `docs/regression/results/codex-support.md`. Matrix reductions require explicit user acceptance.
